> Basically, when you hit Enter, your shell executes your typed command and, after that command terminates, give you the prompt to input another command. The semicolon is analogous, just without the prompt and with you entering both commands before anything is executed.

The exercise is:
> Give it a try now! In this level, you must run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.

* we have to write the command /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college to get the flag
